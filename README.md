# PlantSimShiny
 Simulation and parameter inference visulization on top of the project "Bias in detecting density dependence" at the department of Plant Sciences, Oxford. 
 The app can be found [HERE](https://liangxu-shinyapps.shinyapps.io/PlantSimShiny/).
 
 # Baisc functions
 -- Simulation of plant communities, including dispersal, density dependence;
 -- Linear regression for parameter inference;
 -- Bias studies on dispersal, observation error, and correlation among speceis abundances.
